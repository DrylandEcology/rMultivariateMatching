Description: Simulation models are valuable tools for estimating ecosystem structure and 
    function under various climatic and environmental conditions and disturbance regimes, but
    computational requirements can restrict the number of feasible simulations. Thus, simulation 
    models are often run at coarse scales or for representative points and these results 
    can be difficult to use in decision-making, particularly in topographically complex regions.
    We present methods for interpolating multivariate and time series simulation output to 
    high resolution maps. This package includes tools for site selection, interpolation of complex
    multivariate and timeseries data to high-resolution maps, and estimation of interpolation errors.
