Description: Simulation models are valuable tools for estimating ecosystem 
    structure and function under various climatic and environmental conditions 
    and disturbance regimes, but computational requirements can restrict the 
    number of feasible simulations. Thus, simulation models are often run at 
    coarse scales or for representative points and these results can be difficult 
    to use in decision-making. We present cost-effective methods for interpolating 
    multivariate and time series simulation output to high resolution maps, 
    including tools for site selection, interpolation, and estimation of 
    matching and interpolation errors.
